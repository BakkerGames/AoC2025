# Advent of Code 2025

Trying to solve the 2025 using GRIF, the Game Runner for Interactive Fiction script engine.

GRIF was designed for handling console text-based Interactive Fiction games, similar to Zork.
It does have integer-based mathmatical functions, which will be used to solve as many of the
puzzles as possible.

It also serves as a test for the language. There are missing functions and some bugs which
hopefully can be added/solved in preparation for solving these puzzles.

To run the scripts, put the test or live data into text files and use them as input.

```
Grif.exe 01_1.grif -i 01_test.txt
```

Then use "end" to get the final answer to the puzzle.
